# Find-My-clinic
## A website where all hospital information will be there sorted in a way  such that the best hospitals will be at top and it will be based on the disease you give    This is only the UI/UX .

### Objective : 
This is to help the patients to know which is the best hospital near his/her house and has the appropriate resources for their disease. As we know that all hospitals does not have all the resources for all disease and during emergencies it is very difficult to find a hospital for their disease . Hence we built this website in order to help them find the best hospital near their home with the appropriate amminities and doctors present for their disease.

### Implementation :

1.The main page is the registration page (the file is registration.html) . The patient must create an account in order to access the home page.
  If the patient already has an account he/she may directly sign in to the home page .
  Suppose he/she has forgotten the password then they can click on the hyperlink "forgooten password?"
  
2.After logging into the home page, there is a search bar where the patient can search the disease they have (suppose diabetes.) The search result will be generated   in a manner such that the hospital that is rated highest for that disease (in this case diabetes) and is also near his/her house comes first. Each result consists   of a picture, name and ratings of the hospital and also a Learn More button. (The 'Learn More' button works only for the first result as this is a prototype. It     will have the same results for the other 'Learn More' buttons as well.)

3.On clicking the 'Learn More' button it will take you to the 'Details Page' (File name: details.html). In this page it shows the picture of the hospital in a slider with the ratings and name of the hospital below. Thre are four buttons Check out Doctors, Reviews of Hospital, Book an appointment and Navigate.

   i) On clicking the 'Check out' Doctors button it will show the doctors which are there in thospital for the particular disease he/she searched for  
      (here:diabetes).
      
   ii)  On clicking the 'Reviews of Hospital' button it will show all the reviews of the hospital concerning the particular disease he/she searched for
        (here:diabetes).
        
   iii)On clicking the 'Book an appointment' it will show a calender and also a bar for selecting the time where the patient can choose hi/sher appropriate date and 
       time, and accordingly it will show the results of all the doctors, beds, other aminities available for that particular disease (here:diabetes) on that date 
       and time. Thus, he/she can choose the doctors by seeing the rating of doctors given beside their names and book an appointment.
       
   iv) On clicking the  'Navigate' button it will open Google Maps where it will show the shortest and fastest path from his/her home to the hospital.
   
In the top right of the navigation bar, there is a profile icon where one can logout or edit profile accordingly.

### Application :
This will help the patient to find the appropriate hospital near their home during emergencies. Generally a hospital doesn't come to one's mind during emergencies and it is very difficult to search for one. Hence, I built this website where all the details of hospital can be found at one place without searching for them all around the web. Also, they can search for the disease and will get the list of all hospitals ranked from highest to lowest which provides best medical care for that disease. Not all hospitals have the resources available for all the types of disease. So for this case the website would be helpful.

### Future Aspects :
As future aspect I would like to add a feature to book an ambulance under the chosen hospital, as well as in case of emergencies.
